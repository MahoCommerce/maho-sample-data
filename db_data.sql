It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database. A \"web beacon\" or \"pixel tag\" or \"clear gif\" is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer or mobile device to a website.<br><br>\r\nWe use cookies and web beacons to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the website as well as to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the website you visited immediately before clicking to the Madison Island website. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our website will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. We may also use web beacons, and other technologies, to help track whether our communications are reaching you, to measure their effectiveness, or to collect certain non-personal information about your computer, device, or browser in order to allow us to better design future communications to you.</p><p>\r\n\r\nWe may contract with third parties who may use cookies and web beacons and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services, or data management. We call them our Customer Care Partners. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ONLINE ACCOUNT REGISTRATION</h2><p>\r\nTo make online shopping faster and easier, you may register on the Madison Island website.

Using your name and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information.</p><p>\r\nIf you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to LOG OUT at the conclusion of your session. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>EMAILS</h2><p>\r\nYou will receive promotional emails from us only if you have asked to receive them. If you do not want to receive email from Madison Island or its affiliates you can click on the \"Unsubscribe\" link at the bottom of any email communication sent by us.

Points are awarded based on making purchases and customer actions such as submitting reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Benefits of Reward Points for Registered Customers</h2>\r\n<p>Once you register you will be able to earn and accrue reward points, which are then redeemable at time of purchase towards the cost of your order. Rewards are an added bonus to your shopping experience on the site and just one of the ways we thank you for being a loyal customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Earning Reward Points</h2>\r\n<p>Rewards can currently be earned for the following actions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Making purchases — every time you make a purchase you earn points based on the price of products purchased and these points are added to your Reward Points balance.</li>\r\n<li>Registering on the site.</li>\r\n<li>Subscribing to a newsletter for the first time.</li>\r\n<li>Sending Invitations — Earn points by inviting your friends to join the site.</li>\r\n<li>Converting Invitations to Customer — Earn points for every invitation you send out which leads to your friends registering on the site.</li>\r\n<li>Converting Invitations to Order — Earn points for every invitation you send out which leads to a sale.</li>\r\n<li>Review Submission — Earn points for submitting product reviews.</li>\r\n<li>New Tag Submission — Earn points for adding tags to products.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reward Points Exchange Rates</h2>\r\n<p>The value of reward points is determined by an exchange rate of both currency spent on products to points, and an exchange rate of points earned to currency for spending on future purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Redeeming Reward Points</h2>\r\n<p>You can redeem your reward points at checkout. If you have accumulated enough points to redeem them you will have the option of using points as one of the payment methods.  The option to use reward points, as well as your balance and the monetary equivalent this balance, will be shown to you in the Payment Method area of the checkout.  Redeemable reward points can be used in conjunction with other payment methods such as credit cards, gift cards and more.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Reward Points Minimums and Maximums</h2>\r\n<p>Reward points may be capped at a minimum value required for redemption.  If this option is selected you will not be able to use your reward points until you accrue a minimum number of points, at which point they will become available for redemption.</p>\r\n<p>Reward points may also be capped at the maximum value of points which can be accrued. If this option is selected you will need to redeem your accrued points before you are able to earn more points.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Managing My Reward Points</h2>\r\n<p>You have the ability to view and manage your points through your <a href=\"{{store url=\"customer/account\"}}\">Customer Account</a>. From your account you will be able to view your total points (and currency equivalent), minimum needed to redeem, whether you have reached the maximum points limit and a cumulative history of points acquired, redeemed and lost. The history record will retain and display historical rates and currency for informational purposes. The history will also show you comprehensive informational messages regarding points, including expiration notifications.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Reward Points Expiration</h2>\r\n<p>Reward points can be set to expire. Points will expire in the order form which they were first earned.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can sign up to receive email notifications each time your balance changes when you either earn, redeem or lose points, as well as point expiration notifications. This option is found in the <a href=\"{{store url=\"reward/customer/info\"}}\">Reward Points section</a> of the My Account area.</p>\r\n','2025-01-14 10:12:54','2025-03-22 06:39:47',1,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10,'Company','two_columns_left',NULL,NULL,'company',NULL,'<div class=\"page-head\">\r\n<h3>OUR STORY</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col2-set content-seperator\">\r\n<div class=\"col-1\">\r\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
